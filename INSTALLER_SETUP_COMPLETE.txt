✓ INSTALLER BUILD PROCESS - SETUP COMPLETE
============================================

Created Files:
1. build-installer.bat       - Automated build script
2. TimeTrackerSetup.iss      - Inno Setup installer script
3. BUILD_README.md           - Complete build documentation

How to Build:
=============
Simply double-click: build-installer.bat

What It Does:
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Builds Release version
3. Creates installer (if Inno Setup is installed)

To Create Installer:
====================
1. Install Inno Setup: https://jrsoftware.org/isdown.php (optional, 2 minutes)
2. Run: build-installer.bat
3. Get: TimeTrackerSetup_v1.0.41.exe

Without Inno Setup:
===================
- build-installer.bat still works!
- Creates: TimeTracker.exe (standalone, no installer needed)
- Location: bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\

Next Steps:
===========
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: C:\users\admin\documents\timetracker
3. Double-click: build-installer.bat
4. Follow the prompts

That's it! Your automated build process is ready.
